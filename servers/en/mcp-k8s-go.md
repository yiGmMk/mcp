To use this MCP server with Claude Desktop (or any other client) you might need to choose which way of installation to use.

### Using Smithery

To install MCP K8S Go for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@strowk/mcp-k8s):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @strowk/mcp-k8s --client claude
```

### Using mcp-get

To install MCP K8S Go for Claude Desktop automatically via [mcp-get](https://mcp-get.com/packages/%40strowk%2Fmcp-k8s):

```bash
npx @michaellatman/mcp-get@latest install @strowk/mcp-k8s
```

### Manually with prebuilt binaries

#### Prebuilt from npm

Use this if you have npm installed and want to use pre-built binaries:

```bash
npm install -g @strowk/mcp-k8s
```

Then check version by running `mcp-k8s --version` and if this printed installed version, you can proceed to add configuration to `claude_desktop_config.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp_k8s": {
      "command": "mcp-k8s",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

, or using `npx` with any client:

```bash
npx @strowk/mcp-k8s
```

For example for Claude:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp_k8s": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@strowk/mcp-k8s"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### From GitHub releases

Head to [GitHub releases](https://github.com/strowk/mcp-k8s-go/releases) and download the latest release for your platform.

Unpack the archive, which would contain binary named `mcp-k8s-go`, put that binary somewhere in your PATH and then add the following configuration to the `claude_desktop_config.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp_k8s": {
      "command": "mcp-k8s-go",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

### Building from source

You would need Golang installed to build this project:

```bash
go get github.com/strowk/mcp-k8s-go
go install github.com/strowk/mcp-k8s-go
```

, and then add the following configuration to the `claude_desktop_config.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp_k8s_go": {
      "command": "mcp-k8s-go",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

### Using Docker

This server is built and published to Docker Hub since 0.3.1-beta.2 release with multi-arch images available for linux/amd64 and linux/arm64 architectures.

You can use latest tag f.e like this:

```bash
docker run -i -v ~/.kube/config:/home/nonroot/.kube/config --rm mcpk8s/server:latest
```

Windows users might need to replace `~/.kube/config` with `//c/Users/<username>/.kube/config` at least in Git Bash.

For Claude:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp_k8s_go": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "-v",
        "~/.kube/config:/home/nonroot/.kube/config",
        "--rm",
        "mcpk8s/server:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables and Command-line Options

The following environment variables are used by the MCP server:

- `KUBECONFIG`: Path to your Kubernetes configuration file (optional, defaults to ~/.kube/config)

The following command-line options are supported:

- `--allowed-contexts=<ctx1,ctx2,...>`: Comma-separated list of allowed Kubernetes contexts that users can access. If not specified, all contexts are allowed.
- `--help`: Display help information
- `--version`: Display version information
