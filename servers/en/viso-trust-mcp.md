# VISO TRUST MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for integrating VISO TRUST API capabilities with AI assistants.

## Configuration

### VISO TRUST API Configuration

The following properties can be configured for the VISO TRUST API:

- `visotrust.api.base-url`: The base URL for the VISO TRUST API (default: http://localhost:8080)
- `visotrust.api.token`: Your API token from the VISO TRUST platform (required)
- `visotrust.api.timeout`: API request timeout in milliseconds (default: 30000)
- `visotrust.api.connect-timeout`: API connection timeout in milliseconds (default: 5000)

For information on how to generate an API token for the `visotrust.api.token` environment variable, see the [VISO TRUST support documentation](https://support.visotrust.com/article/olo26aapun-generateaccesstoken).

### Manual Setup with VS Code
Add the following JSON block to your User Settings (JSON) file in VS Code. You can do this by pressing Ctrl + Shift + P and typing Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON).
```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "inputs": [
      {
        "type": "promptString",
        "id": "viso_baseurl",
        "description": "VISO TRUST API Base URL",
        "default": "https://app.visotrust.com"
      },
      {
        "type": "promptString",
        "id": "viso_token",
        "description": "VISO TRUST API Token",
        "password": true
      }
    ],
    "servers": {
      "viso-mcp": {
        "command": "docker",
        "args": [
          "run",
          "-i",
          "--rm",
          "-e",
          "VISOTRUST_API_TOKEN",
          "-e",
          "VISOTRUST_API_BASEURL",
          "visotrustai/viso-mcp-server:latest"
        ],
        "env": {
          "VISOTRUST_API_BASEURL": "${input:viso_baseurl}",
          "VISOTRUST_API_TOKEN": "${input:viso_token}"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Optionally, you can add a similar example (i.e. without the mcp key) to a file called .vscode/mcp.json in your workspace. This will allow you to share the configuration with others.
```json
{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "type": "promptString",
      "id": "viso_baseurl",
      "description": "VISO TRUST API Base URL",
      "default": "https://app.visotrust.com"
    },
    {
      "type": "promptString",
      "id": "viso_token",
      "description": "VISO TRUST API Token",
      "password": true
    }
  ],
  "servers": {
    "viso-mcp": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e",
        "VISOTRUST_API_TOKEN",
        "-e",
        "VISOTRUST_API_BASEURL",
        "visotrustai/viso-mcp-server:latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "VISOTRUST_API_BASEURL": "${input:viso_baseurl}",
        "VISOTRUST_API_TOKEN": "${input:viso_token}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
