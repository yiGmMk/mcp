[Zapier](https://zapier.com) is a cloud-based automation tool that allows users to connect their favorite applications through "Zaps" (automated workflows). Each Zap consists of a trigger (an event that initiates the workflow) and one or more actions (tasks to be executed). It supports over 7,000 applications and more than 30,000 actions, making it ideal for integrating various services and streamlining business processes.

## What is Zapier MCP?

[Zapier MCP](https://zapier.com/mcp) is Zapier's implementation of the Model Context Protocol (Claude MCP). Zapier MCP extends this technology by creating a seamless bridge between complex AI systems (such as Claude) and Zapier's extensive ecosystem of over 7,000 applications and 30,000+ actions. This powerful combination unlocks unprecedented capabilities for automated workflows, contextual decision-making, and enhanced AI-driven applications—without requiring extensive development resources or specialized coding expertise.

Zapier MCP enables AI assistants to:

- Access and manipulate data: Read from and write to databases, CRMs, project management tools, and more.
- Execute automation: Trigger predefined Zaps or create new ones based on configurations.
- Interact with external services: Make API calls through Zapier-supported services, such as sending messages, creating files, or updating records.
- Securely manage credentials: Ensure all interactions are conducted safely with proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Customize actions: Define permitted operations for the AI to control data usage.

At its core, Zapier MCP serves as a specialized **middleware layer** that facilitates structured communication between AI systems and thousands of applications within Zapier's integration ecosystem. The protocol operates via RESTful API endpoints compliant with the OpenAPI specification, allowing AI models to:

- Discover available tools through schema definitions
- Parse and validate input parameters before execution
- Perform actions in connected applications
- Return structured responses to the AI model

This bidirectional communication occurs in real-time, enabling AI assistants to execute complex tasks based on user requests, environmental triggers, or scheduled events.

The overall data flow response process of Zapier MCP is illustrated below:

```

## How to Use Zapier MCP?

Using Zapier MCP requires just four steps:

1. Generate Your MCP Endpoint: Obtain your unique, dynamic MCP endpoint, which connects your AI assistant to Zapier's integration network.
2. Configure Your Actions: Easily select and configure specific actions your AI can perform, such as sending Slack messages or managing Google Calendar events, ensuring precise control.
3. Connect Your AI Assistant: Seamlessly link your AI assistant using the generated MCP endpoint to start executing tasks immediately.
4. Test and Monitor: Verify that your AI assistant functions as expected and use Zapier's monitoring tools to track its performance.

### Step 1: Generate Your Zapier MCP Endpoint

To generate your Zapier MCP endpoint, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Zapier account.
2. Navigate to the settings page: [https://actions.zapier.com/settings/mcp/](https://actions.zapier.com/settings/mcp/)

   ![Zapier MCP Settings](/images/zapier-mcp-settings.jpg)

   Click the `Generate URL` button to create your Zapier MCP endpoint. A URL like `https://actions.zapier.com/mcp/sk-ak-xxxxx/sse` will be generated—this is your Zapier MCP endpoint.

### Step 2: Configure Your Actions

On the same page where your Zapier MCP endpoint was generated, below the URL, you'll find an `Edit MCP Actions` button. Click it to access the [Actions Configuration Page](https://actions.zapier.com/mcp/actions/). Here, you can view all available actions and enable those you wish to use.

You can also click the `Add a new Action` button to create a new action.

### Step 3: Connect Your AI Assistant

Now, you can connect your AI assistant. Use an MCP client to link to Zapier via the generated MCP endpoint.

For example, if you're using Cursor, go to the MCP tab in Cursor's settings and click the `Add new global MCP server` button. In the pop-up `mcp.json` file, add the following MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Zapier": {
      "url": "https://actions.zapier.com/mcp/<sk-ak-xxxx>/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

For project-specific use, create a `.cursor/mcp.json` file in your project's root directory and add the same configuration.

Once configured, the Zapier tab will appear in Cursor MCP. Ensure it's enabled to view the list of tools provided by Zapier.

### Step 4: Test and Monitor

Now, you can test your Zapier MCP integration in Cursor. For instance, you can summarize an article and send it to a specified email address.
