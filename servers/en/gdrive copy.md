A Model Context Protocol server for Google Drive. This server integrates with Google Drive to allow listing, reading, and searching over files.

## Components

### Tools

- **search**
  - Search for files in Google Drive
  - Input: `query` (string): Search query
  - Returns file names and MIME types of matching files

### Resources

The server provides access to Google Drive files:

- **Files** (`gdrive:///<file_id>`)
  - Supports all file types
  - Google Workspace files are automatically exported:
    - Docs → Markdown
    - Sheets → CSV
    - Presentations → Plain text
    - Drawings → PNG
  - Other files are provided in their native format

## Getting started

1. [Create a new Google Cloud project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate)
2. [Enable the Google Drive API](https://console.cloud.google.com/workspace-api/products)
3. [Configure an OAuth consent screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent) ("internal" is fine for testing)
4. Add OAuth scope `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`
5. [Create an OAuth Client ID](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/oauthclient) for application type "Desktop App"
6. Download the JSON file of your client's OAuth keys
7. Rename the key file to `gcp-oauth.keys.json` and place into the root of this repo (i.e. `servers/gcp-oauth.keys.json`)

Make sure to build the server with either `npm run build` or `npm run watch`.

### Authentication

To authenticate and save credentials:

1. Run the server with the `auth` argument: `node ./dist auth`
2. This will open an authentication flow in your system browser
3. Complete the authentication process
4. Credentials will be saved in the root of this repo (i.e. `servers/.gdrive-server-credentials.json`)

### Usage with Desktop App

To integrate this server with the desktop app, add the following to your app's server configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gdrive": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-gdrive"]
    }
  }
}
```
