[Figma Context MCP](/servers/figma-context-mcp) is a powerful [MCP Server](/servers) that helps developers extract information directly from Figma designs and rapidly implement them via AI agents. For example, in Cursor, you can prompt an AI Agent to access your Figma design data and generate code. Compared to directly pasting screenshots, the final output is significantly better.

## Obtaining a Figma Access Token

Before using the Figma Context MCP server, you need to generate a Figma access token. Here are the detailed steps:

1. Log in to Figma, click your profile icon in the top-left corner, and select "Settings" from the dropdown menu.
2. In the settings menu, navigate to the "Security" tab.
3. Scroll down to the "Personal access tokens" section and click "Generate new token."
4. Enter a name for the token (e.g., "Figma MCP") and ensure you have read permissions for `File content` and `Dev resources`.

5. Click the "Generate token" button.

> **Important**: Immediately copy and securely store the generated token. Once you close this page, you will not be able to view the full token again.

For more detailed guidance, refer to [Figma's official documentation on access tokens](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/8085703771159-Manage-personal-access-tokens).

## Configuring the Figma Context MCP Server

Most MCP clients support configuring MCP servers via JSON. Once you update the MCP configuration in your client, the server will be automatically downloaded and enabled.

Choose the appropriate configuration based on your operating system:

**MacOS / Linux:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Figma MCP": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "figma-developer-mcp",
        "--figma-api-key=YOUR-KEY",
        "--stdio"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Windows:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Framelink Figma MCP": {
      "command": "cmd",
      "args": [
        "/c",
        "npx",
        "-y",
        "figma-developer-mcp",
        "--figma-api-key=YOUR-KEY",
        "--stdio"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

> **Important**: Replace `YOUR-KEY` in the configuration with the Figma access token you generated earlier.

Configuration steps may vary slightly across different [MCP clients](/clients). Here, we focus on configuring it in Cursor:

1. Open Cursor settings (CMD+, or Ctrl+,).
2. Navigate to the MCP configuration section.
3. Click the `+ Add new global MCP server` button in the top-right corner.
4. Paste the JSON configuration provided above.

Alternatively, you can create a `.cursor/mcp.json` file in your project's root directory and add the configuration there. This ensures the MCP Server only applies to the current project.

At this point, the MCP server setup is complete.

## Implementing Your First Design

Once the MCP client is configured, you can start implementing your first design.

### Copy the Link to a Figma Frame or Group

The MCP server compresses data received from the Figma API by nearly 90%. However, complex designs may still overwhelm the AI agent due to excessive information (exceeding token limits).

**While you can attempt to implement the entire design at once, for the most consistent results, we recommend working on one section at a time.**

To do this: **Right-click the frame or group you want to implement, select "Copy/Paste as," and then choose "Copy link to selection."**

![Copy Link to Figma Frame or Group](/images/figma-context-mcp-copy-figma-link.png)

### Paste the Link into the Editor

After obtaining the link, prompt the editor's AI agent to process it.

For example, in Cursor, you might enter: `Implement this Figma frame for me. https://www.figma.com/design/....`. Note that when pasting the link directly into Cursor, it may automatically recognize it as a hyperlink and attempt to fetch the page content. To prevent this, click the URL, then select `Unlink` to treat it as plain text.

![Paste Link into Editor](/images/figma-context-mcp-paste-link.png)

After pressing Enter, Cursor will analyze the request and invoke the MCP server's `get_figma_data` tool to retrieve the design data. If images are involved, it will use the `download_figma_images` tool to fetch them. Finally, the AI agent generates the corresponding code based on this data.

![Calling Figma MCP Tools](/images/figma-context-mcp-call-tool.png)

The resulting page will look something like this:

![Final Generated Page](/images/figma-context-mcp-final-result.png)

It closely matches the design, though some fine-tuning may still be needed.

You can also specify the tech stack, naming conventions, or other requirements in your prompt. Providing more context typically yields better results.

```bash
Create a responsive page based on this Figma design:

https://www.figma.com/file/xxxxx

Tech stack requirements:
- HTML/CSS
- Use Tailwind CSS
- Ensure mobile compatibility
```

And there you have it—your first design implementation, simplified!

## Best Practices

To maximize the potential of Figma Context MCP, consider these best practices:

**In Figma**

Structure your Figma files for clarity and ease of implementation:

- Use auto-layout—MCP currently handles floating or absolutely positioned elements less effectively.
- Name your frames and groups.
- Tip: Leverage Figma's AI to auto-generate names.

**In Your Editor**

Providing the right context is key when working with LLMs:

- Specify available resources (e.g., Tailwind, React).
- Reference key files in your codebase for additional context.
- Supplement Figma data with design details.
- Manage context size—provide links to frames or groups rather than entire files (to avoid token limits).
- Always review AI-generated code to ensure it meets your standards.

## SSE Configuration

In addition to the earlier setup, Figma MCP also supports Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming responses to clients.

**Starting the MCP Server**

Use the `npx` command to launch the MCP server:

```bash
npx figma-developer-mcp --figma-api-key=<your-figma-api-key>
# Initializing Figma MCP Server in HTTP mode on port 3333...
# HTTP server listening on port 3333
# SSE endpoint available at http://localhost:3333/sse
# Message endpoint available at http://localhost:3333/messages
```

**Configuring the MCP Client**

Update your MCP client configuration as follows:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Framelink Figma MCP": {
      "url": "http://localhost:3333/sse",
      "env": {
        "FIGMA_API_KEY": "<your-figma-api-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with Figma Context MCP, here are some common problems and solutions:

### Issue: MCP Server Fails to Connect

**Solution**:

- Verify the Figma access token is correctly configured.
- Check your internet connection.
- Restart your IDE.
- Ensure the `npx` command is available (requires Node.js).

### Issue: Generated Code Doesn't Meet Expectations

**Solution**:

- Provide more specific instructions.
- Work with smaller design sections.
- Ensure Figma designs are well-organized and named.
- Experiment with different prompts.

### Issue: Access Token Permission Errors

**Solution**:

- Confirm your token has the necessary permissions (`File content` and `Dev resources` read access).
- Generate a new token if needed.

## Conclusion

Figma Context MCP is a powerful MCP Server that seamlessly bridges Figma and Cursor, enabling effortless extraction of design data and rapid implementation via AI agents. It transforms designs into code with remarkable efficiency—a tool well worth recommending.
