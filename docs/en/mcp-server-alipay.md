`@alipay/mcp-server-alipay` is an MCP Server provided by Alipay Open Platform, allowing you to easily integrate transaction creation, query, refund and other capabilities from Alipay Open Platform into your LLM applications, and further create intelligent tools with payment capabilities.

Below is a simplified fictional use case to help understand the tool's capabilities:

> An illustrator wants to earn income by providing custom original illustration services. Traditionally, they would need to repeatedly communicate with each client about requirements, determine pricing, send payment links, and then manually confirm payment status - a cumbersome and time-consuming process.
>
> Now, using Alipay MCP Server with intelligent Agent tools, the illustrator has developed a smart chat application (web or mini-program) through the Agent platform. Clients only need to describe their illustration requirements in the application (such as style preferences, illustration purpose, delivery time, etc.), and the AI will automatically analyze the requirements, quickly generate accurate and reasonable custom quotes, and instantly create dedicated Alipay payment links through the tool.
>
> After the client clicks and completes payment, the creator immediately receives a notification and enters the creation phase. Without the need for manual back-and-forth dialogue to confirm transaction status or payment situation, the entire process is not only convenient and smooth but also significantly improves transaction efficiency and customer satisfaction, allowing illustrators to focus more on their creative work and achieve a more effortless personalized service business model.

## How to Choose the Appropriate Payment Method

During development, to help the LLM choose the appropriate payment method more accurately, it's recommended to clearly explain your product usage scenario in the prompt:

- **QR Code Payment (`webPagePay`)**: Suitable for scenarios where users see the payment interface on a computer screen. If your application or website primarily runs on desktop (PC), you can specify in your prompt: "My application is desktop software/PC website, and needs to display a payment QR code on the computer."
- **Mobile Payment (`mobilePay`)**: Suitable for scenarios where users initiate payment within a mobile browser. If your application is a mobile H5 page or mobile website, you can specify in your prompt: "My page is a mobile website, and needs to directly invoke Alipay payment on the mobile phone."

We will provide more payment methods suitable for AI applications in the future. Stay tuned.
