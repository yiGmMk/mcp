A Model Context Protocol server for Git repository interaction and automation. This server provides tools to read, search, and manipulate Git repositories via Large Language Models.

Please note that mcp-server-git is currently in early development. The functionality and available tools are subject to change and expansion as we continue to develop and improve the server.

## Installation

### Using uv (recommended)

When using [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) no specific installation is needed. We will
use [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) to directly run _mcp-server-git_.

### Using PIP

Alternatively you can install `mcp-server-git` via pip:

```
pip install mcp-server-git
```

After installation, you can run it as a script using:

```
python -m mcp_server_git
```

## Configuration

### Usage with Claude Desktop

Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

<details>
<summary>Using uvx</summary>

```json
"mcpServers": {
  "git": {
    "command": "uvx",
    "args": ["mcp-server-git", "--repository", "path/to/git/repo"]
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Using pip installation</summary>

```json
"mcpServers": {
  "git": {
    "command": "python",
    "args": ["-m", "mcp_server_git", "--repository", "path/to/git/repo"]
  }
}
```

</details>

### Usage with [Zed](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed)

Add to your Zed settings.json:

<details>
<summary>Using uvx</summary>

```json
"context_servers": [
  "mcp-server-git": {
    "command": {
      "path": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-git"]
    }
  }
],
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Using pip installation</summary>

```json
"context_servers": {
  "mcp-server-git": {
    "command": {
      "path": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "mcp_server_git"]
    }
  }
},
```

</details>

## Debugging

You can use the MCP inspector to debug the server. For uvx installations:

```
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uvx mcp-server-git
```

Or if you've installed the package in a specific directory or are developing on it:

```
cd path/to/servers/src/git
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv run mcp-server-git
```

Running `tail -n 20 -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log` will show the logs from the server and may
help you debug any issues.

## Development

If you are doing local development, there are two ways to test your changes:

1. Run the MCP inspector to test your changes. See [Debugging](#debugging) for run instructions.

2. Test using the Claude desktop app. Add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
"git": {
  "command": "uv",
  "args": [
    "--directory",
    "/<path to mcp-servers>/mcp-servers/src/git",
    "run",
    "mcp-server-git"
  ]
}
```
